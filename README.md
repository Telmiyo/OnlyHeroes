OnlyHeroes is a simple and fun Hunger Games plugin for Minecraft. It is inspired on the big and loved server MCSG which was known by its famous and competitive Hunger Games stand by the old pvp style. Unfortunatelly, this server closed some years ago. So here OnlyHeroes comes, to let new servers introduce this plugin and have an oportunity to revive this great community.
